# Drum-Kit-website
We all must have seen a drum kit in some concert or elsewhere, it is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments. 
But have you ever imagined making that drum kit on your own virtually with the help of some scripting language? 
Well, so here we are with the goal for this article to build a drum kit app that runs in the browser. 
The main concepts presented in the article are DOM, key events and CSS animations. 
The user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular button on your Website and you can respond to it, but you also end up with an awesome Website that 
you can impress all of your friends with.
